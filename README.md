Analysis for transparency study 

## Experiment parts
The diagram in experiment_parts.pdf illustrates the sequencing of the experiment and names each component. 
* Note that "actions" are also referred to as "commands" or "tasks".
* The smallest component, "attempt" is a subdivision of command. Attempts do not appear in the diagram since the number of attempts in a given command depends on user performance in delivering that command.
